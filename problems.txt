ig_service = IGService(username, password, api_key, acc_type="DEMO")

# Log in
ig_service.create_session()

# Search for the S&P 500 epic
search_results = ig_service.search_markets("S&P")

# Print results to inspect the structure
print(search_results)

# Handle different structures
try:
    for index, row in search_results.iterrows():  # If it's a DataFrame
        print(f"Epic: {row['epic']}, Name: {row['instrumentName']}")
except KeyError:
